"Instruction tuning significantly improves zero-shot performance on unseen tasks compared to models fine-tuned on the dataset name only. This is because training with instructions is crucial for zero-shot performance. 

Instruction tuning can also be used when few-shot exemplars are available at inference time. The instruction format for the few-shot setting builds on the zero-shot format and includes the few-shot exemplars.

"Zero-shot-CoT differs from Few-shot-CoT in terms of prompting methods for large language models. Zero-shot-CoT does not require any examples for prompting, while Few-shot-CoT requires a few examples to guide the model.
