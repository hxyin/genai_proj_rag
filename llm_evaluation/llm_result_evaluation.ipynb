His mass-energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from relativity theory, has been called 'the world's most famous equation'. He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics 'for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect', a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. In a 1999 poll of 130 leading physicists worldwide by the British journal Physics World, Einstein was ranked the greatest physicist of all time.

For this setup, we hold out NLI, closed-book QA, and\\ncommonsense reasoning as evaluation clusters, and use the seven remaining clusters for instruction\\ntuning.3 We show results for one to seven instruction tuning clusters, where clusters are added in\\ndecreasing order of number of tasks per cluster.\\nFigure 6 shows these results.

As expected, we observe that average performance across the three\\nheld-out clusters improves as we add additional clusters and tasks to instruction tuning (with the\\nexception of the sentiment analysis cluster), confirming the benefits of our proposed instruction\\ntuning approach on zero-shot performance on novel tasks. It is further interesting to see that, for\\nthe seven clusters we test, the performance does not appear to saturate, implying that performance\\nmay further improve with even more clusters added to instruction tuning.

For this setup, we hold out NLI, closed-book QA, and\\ncommonsense reasoning as evaluation clusters, and use the seven remaining clusters for instruction\\ntuning.3 We show results for one to seven instruction tuning clusters, where clusters are added in\\ndecreasing order of number of tasks per cluster.\\nFigure 6 shows these results.

As expected, we observe that average performance across the three\\nheld-out clusters improves as we add additional clusters and tasks to instruction tuning (with the\\nexception of the sentiment analysis cluster), confirming the benefits of our proposed instruction\\ntuning approach on zero-shot performance on novel tasks. It is further interesting to see that, for\\nthe seven clusters we test, the performance does not appear to saturate, implying that performance\\nmay further improve with even more clusters added to instruction tuning. Of note, this ablation does\\nnot allow us to draw conclusions about which instruction tuning cluster contributes the most to each\\nevaluation cluster, although we see minimal added value from the sentiment analysis cluster.\\nPerformance (%) \\non held-out cluster\\nClusters used for instruction tuning\\n50\\n70\\n90\\n– Average\\nHeld-out clusters\\n30\\n# clusters: \\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n+ summarization\\n+ translation\\n+ read. comp.\\n(# datasets): \\n(11)\\n(20)\\ninstructions.

Notably, chain of thought (CoT) prompting,\\na recent technique for eliciting complex multi-step reasoning through step-bystep answer examples, achieved the state-of-the-art performances in arithmetics\\nand symbolic reasoning, difficult system-2 tasks that do not follow the standard\\nscaling laws for LLMs. While these successes are often attributed to LLMs’\\nability for few-shot learning, we show that LLMs are decent zero-shot reasoners\\nby simply adding “Let’s think step by step” before each answer. Experimental\\nconfirm that it is not specially engineered for multi-step reasoning.\\nLimitation and Social Impact\\nOur work is based on prompting methods for large language models.\\nLLMs have been trained on large corpora from various sources on the web (also see “Training Dataset\\nDetails”), and have shown to capture and amplify biases found in the training data. Prompting is a\\nmethod that looks to take advantage of the patterns captured by language models conducive to various\\ntasks, and therefore it has the same shortcomings. This being said, our approach is a more direct way\\nto probe complex reasoning inside pre-trained LLMs, removing the confounding factor of in-context\\nlearning in prior few-shot approaches, and can lead to more unbiased study of biases in LLMs.\\n6\\nConclusion\\nWe have proposed Zero-shot-CoT, a single zero-shot prompt that elicits chain of thought from large\\nlanguage models across a variety of reasoning tasks, in contrast to the few-shot (in-context) approach\\nChain of thought prompting\\nMulti-step arithmetic and logical reasoning benchmarks have particularly challenged the scaling laws of large language models [Rae et al., 2021]. Chain of thought\\n(CoT) prompting [Wei et al., 2022], an instance of few-shot prompting, proposed a simple solution\\nby modifying the answers in few-shot examples to step-by-step answers, and achieved significant\\nboosts in performance across these difficult benchmarks, especially when combined with very large\\nlanguage models like PaLM [Chowdhery et al., 2022]. The top row of Figure 1 shows standard\\nfew-shot prompting against (few-shot) CoT prompting. Notably, few-shot learning was taken as a\\ngiven for tackling such difficult tasks, and the zero-shot baseline performances were not even reported\\nin the original work [Wei et al., 2022]. To differentiate it from our method, we call Wei et al. [2022]\\nas Few-shot-CoT in this work.\\n3\\nZero-shot Chain of Thought\\nFew-shot-CoT ([Wei et al., 2022]), (c) standard Zero-shot, and (d) ours (Zero-shot-CoT). Similar to\\nFew-shot-CoT, Zero-shot-CoT facilitates multi-step reasoning (blue text) and reach correct answer\\nwhere standard prompting fails. Unlike Few-shot-CoT using step-by-step reasoning examples per\\ntask, ours does not need any examples and just uses the same prompt “Let’s think step by step” across\\nall tasks (arithmetic, symbolic, commonsense, and other logical reasoning tasks).\\nIn contrast to the excellent performance of LLMs in intuitive and single-step system-1 [Stanovich\\nand West, 2000] tasks with task-specific few-shot or zero-shot prompting [Liu et al., 2021b], even\\nlanguage models at the scale of 100B or more parameters had struggled on system-2 tasks requiring\\nslow and multi-step reasoning [Rae et al., 2021]. To address this shortcoming, Wei et al. [2022],\\nWang et al. [2022] have proposed chain of thought prompting (CoT), which feed LLMs with the\",\n",

He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics 'for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect', a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science.

We use the same split as in §4.1, where the NLI, commonsense reasoning, and\\nclosed-book QA clusters are held-out, and seven other task clusters remain for instruction tuning. For\\nthese seven task clusters, we instruction tune models using just one dataset per task cluster and using\\nfour datasets per task cluster (for task clusters that did not have four tasks, we just used all available\\ntasks).

Our instruction-tuned model, FLAN, improves\\nperformance against an untuned model and surpasses zero-shot GPT-3 on the majority of tasks that\\nwe evaluate on.

We operationalize\\nthis question via instruction tuning, a simple method that combines appealing aspects of both\\nthe pretrain–finetune and prompting paradigms. Our instruction-tuned model, FLAN, improves\\nperformance against an untuned model and surpasses zero-shot GPT-3 on the majority of tasks that\\nwe evaluate on. Ablation studies reveal that performance on unseen tasks improves with the number\\nof instruction tuning task clusters, and, interestingly, that performance improvements from instruction\\ntuning emerge only with sufficient model scale. Moreover, instruction tuning can be combined with\\nother prompting methods such as few-shot prompting and prompt tuning.\\nThe diverse capabilities of language models at scale have drawn attention to the tradeoffs between\\nother prompting methods such as few-shot prompting and prompt tuning.\\nThe diverse capabilities of language models at scale have drawn attention to the tradeoffs between\\nspecialist models (one model per task) and generalist models (one model for many tasks; Arivazhagan\\net al., 2019; Pratap et al., 2020), for which our study has potential implications. Although one might\\nexpect labeled data to have the most natural role in improving specialist models, instruction tuning\\ndemonstrates how labeled data can be used to help large language models perform many, unseen\\ntasks. In other words, the positive effect of instruction tuning on cross-task generalization shows that\\ntask-specific training is complementary to general language modeling and motivates further research\\non generalist models.\\nAs for limitations of our study, there is a degree of subjectivity in assigning tasks to clusters (though\\nwe try to use accepted categorizations in the literature), and we only explore the use of relatively\",\n",

The idea is that by using supervision to teach an LM to perform tasks described via\\ninstructions, the LM will learn to follow instructions and do so even for unseen tasks. To evaluate\\nperformance on unseen tasks, we group datasets into clusters by task type and hold out each task\\ncluster for evaluation while instruction tuning on all remaining clusters.\\n2\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2022\\net al., 2021). Compared with this prior work that finetunes and evaluates on the same downstream\\ntask, our setup studies the effect of instruction tuning on ability to perform unseen tasks.\\nD.5\\nMULTI-TASK QUESTION ANSWERING\\nThe instructions we use for instruction tuning are similar to QA-based task formulation research,\\nwhich aims to unify NLP tasks by casting them as question-answering over a context. For instance,\\nMcCann et al. (2018) cast ten NLP tasks as QA and train a model on a collection of tasks formulated\\nwith natural language prompts; they report transfer learning gains on finetuning tasks as well as\\nzero-shot domain adaptation results on SNLI (Bowman et al., 2015) and Amazon/Yelp Reviews\\n(Kotzias et al., 2015). While McCann et al. (2018) does not leverage unsupervised pre-training and\\nonly reports zero-shot transfer to unseen domains, our work uses a pretrained LM and focuses on\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2022\\nB\\nFURTHER ABLATION STUDIES AND ANALYSIS\\nB.1\\nDATASETS PER TASK CLUSTER & TEMPLATES PER DATASET\\nOur primary hypothesis is that instruction tuning on a diverse set of tasks improves performance on\\nunseen tasks. §4.1 showed that adding more task clusters improves performance; here, we further\\nexplore whether adding additional datasets improves performance when the number of task clusters\\nis held constant. We use the same split as in §4.1, where the NLI, commonsense reasoning, and\\nclosed-book QA clusters are held-out, and seven other task clusters remain for instruction tuning. For\\nthese seven task clusters, we instruction tune models using just one dataset per task cluster and using\\nfour datasets per task cluster (for task clusters that did not have four tasks, we just used all available\\ntasks). In addition, we simultaneously explore the role of the number of instruction templates per\\nraters (Ouyang et al., 2022).\\n6\\nDISCUSSION\\nOur paper has explored a simple question in zero-shot prompting: does finetuning a model on a\\ncollection of tasks phrased as instructions improve its performance on unseen tasks? We operationalize\\nthis question via instruction tuning, a simple method that combines appealing aspects of both\\nthe pretrain–finetune and prompting paradigms. Our instruction-tuned model, FLAN, improves\\nperformance against an untuned model and surpasses zero-shot GPT-3 on the majority of tasks that\\nwe evaluate on. Ablation studies reveal that performance on unseen tasks improves with the number\\nof instruction tuning task clusters, and, interestingly, that performance improvements from instruction\\ntuning emerge only with sufficient model scale. Moreover, instruction tuning can be combined with\\nother prompting methods such as few-shot prompting and prompt tuning.\\nThe diverse capabilities of language models at scale have drawn attention to the tradeoffs between\",\n",

Best known for developing the theory of relativity, he also made important contributions to quantum mechanics, and was thus a central figure in the revolutionary reshaping of the scientific understanding of nature that modern physics accomplished in the first decades of the twentieth century. His mass-energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from relativity theory, has been called 'the world's most famous equation'. He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics 'for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect', a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. In a 1999 poll of 130 leading physicists worldwide by the British journal Physics World, Einstein was ranked the greatest physicist of all time. His intellectual achievements and originality have made Einstein synonymous with genius.\",\n",

      "    \"context\": \"Chain of thought prompting\\nMulti-step arithmetic and logical reasoning benchmarks have particularly challenged the scaling laws of large language models [Rae et al., 2021]. Chain of thought\\n(CoT) prompting [Wei et al., 2022], an instance of few-shot prompting, proposed a simple solution\\nby modifying the answers in few-shot examples to step-by-step answers, and achieved significant\\nboosts in performance across these difficult benchmarks, especially when combined with very large\\nlanguage models like PaLM [Chowdhery et al., 2022]. The top row of Figure 1 shows standard\\nfew-shot prompting against (few-shot) CoT prompting. Notably, few-shot learning was taken as a\\ngiven for tackling such difficult tasks, and the zero-shot baseline performances were not even reported\\nin the original work [Wei et al., 2022]. To differentiate it from our method, we call Wei et al. [2022]\\nas Few-shot-CoT in this work.\\n3\\nZero-shot Chain of Thought\\ntemplates, the performance does not improve. It remains an open question how to automatically\\ncreate better templates for Zero-shot-CoT.\\nHow does prompt selection affect Few-shot-CoT?\\nTable 5 shows the performance of Fewshot-CoT when using examples from different datasets: CommonsenseQA to AQUA-RAT and\\nCommonsenseQA to MultiArith. The domains are different in both cases, but the answer format\\n8\\nFew-shot-CoT ([Wei et al., 2022]), (c) standard Zero-shot, and (d) ours (Zero-shot-CoT). Similar to\\nFew-shot-CoT, Zero-shot-CoT facilitates multi-step reasoning (blue text) and reach correct answer\\nwhere standard prompting fails. Unlike Few-shot-CoT using step-by-step reasoning examples per\\ntask, ours does not need any examples and just uses the same prompt “Let’s think step by step” across\\nall tasks (arithmetic, symbolic, commonsense, and other logical reasoning tasks).\\nIn contrast to the excellent performance of LLMs in intuitive and single-step system-1 [Stanovich\\nand West, 2000] tasks with task-specific few-shot or zero-shot prompting [Liu et al., 2021b], even\\nlanguage models at the scale of 100B or more parameters had struggled on system-2 tasks requiring\\nslow and multi-step reasoning [Rae et al., 2021]. To address this shortcoming, Wei et al. [2022],\\nWang et al. [2022] have proposed chain of thought prompting (CoT), which feed LLMs with the\\nconfirm that it is not specially engineered for multi-step reasoning.\\nLimitation and Social Impact\\nOur work is based on prompting methods for large language models.\\nLLMs have been trained on large corpora from various sources on the web (also see “Training Dataset\\nDetails”), and have shown to capture and amplify biases found in the training data. Prompting is a\\nmethod that looks to take advantage of the patterns captured by language models conducive to various\\ntasks, and therefore it has the same shortcomings. This being said, our approach is a more direct way\\nto probe complex reasoning inside pre-trained LLMs, removing the confounding factor of in-context\\nlearning in prior few-shot approaches, and can lead to more unbiased study of biases in LLMs.\\n6\\nConclusion\\nWe have proposed Zero-shot-CoT, a single zero-shot prompt that elicits chain of thought from large\\nlanguage models across a variety of reasoning tasks, in contrast to the few-shot (in-context) approach\",\n",

His mass-energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from relativity theory, has been called 'the world's most famous equation'. He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics 'for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect', a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. In a 1999 poll of 130 leading physicists worldwide by the British journal Physics World, Einstein was ranked the greatest physicist of all time.

Similar to\\nFew-shot-CoT, Zero-shot-CoT facilitates multi-step reasoning (blue text) and reach correct answer\\nwhere standard prompting fails. Unlike Few-shot-CoT using step-by-step reasoning examples per\\ntask, ours does not need any examples and just uses the same prompt “Let’s think step by step” across\\nall tasks (arithmetic, symbolic, commonsense, and other logical reasoning tasks).\\nIn contrast to the excellent performance of LLMs in intuitive and single-step system-1 [Stanovich\\nand West, 2000] tasks with task-specific few-shot or zero-shot prompting [Liu et al., 2021b], even\\nlanguage models at the scale of 100B or more parameters had struggled on system-2 tasks requiring\\nslow and multi-step reasoning [Rae et al., 2021]. To address this shortcoming, Wei et al. [2022],\\nWang et al. [2022] have proposed chain of thought prompting (CoT), which feed LLMs with the\\nconfirm that it is not specially engineered for multi-step reasoning.\\nLimitation and Social Impact\\nOur work is based on prompting methods for large language models.\\nLLMs have been trained on large corpora from various sources on the web (also see “Training Dataset\\nDetails”), and have shown to capture and amplify biases found in the training data. Prompting is a\\nmethod that looks to take advantage of the patterns captured by language models conducive to various\\ntasks, and therefore it has the same shortcomings. This being said, our approach is a more direct way\\nto probe complex reasoning inside pre-trained LLMs, removing the confounding factor of in-context\\nlearning in prior few-shot approaches, and can lead to more unbiased study of biases in LLMs.\\n6\\nConclusion\\nWe have proposed Zero-shot-CoT, a single zero-shot prompt that elicits chain of thought from large\\nlanguage models across a variety of reasoning tasks, in contrast to the few-shot (in-context) approach\",\n",

His mass-energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from relativity theory, has been called 'the world's most famous equation'. He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics 'for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect', a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science.

      "    \"context\": \"Chain of thought prompting\\nMulti-step arithmetic and logical reasoning benchmarks have particularly challenged the scaling laws of large language models [Rae et al., 2021]. Chain of thought\\n(CoT) prompting [Wei et al., 2022], an instance of few-shot prompting, proposed a simple solution\\nby modifying the answers in few-shot examples to step-by-step answers, and achieved significant\\nboosts in performance across these difficult benchmarks, especially when combined with very large\\nlanguage models like PaLM [Chowdhery et al., 2022]. The top row of Figure 1 shows standard\\nfew-shot prompting against (few-shot) CoT prompting. Notably, few-shot learning was taken as a\\ngiven for tackling such difficult tasks, and the zero-shot baseline performances were not even reported\\nin the original work [Wei et al., 2022]. To differentiate it from our method, we call Wei et al. [2022]\\nas Few-shot-CoT in this work.\\n3\\nZero-shot Chain of Thought\\nconfirm that it is not specially engineered for multi-step reasoning.\\nLimitation and Social Impact\\nOur work is based on prompting methods for large language models.\\nLLMs have been trained on large corpora from various sources on the web (also see “Training Dataset\\nDetails”), and have shown to capture and amplify biases found in the training data. Prompting is a\\nmethod that looks to take advantage of the patterns captured by language models conducive to various\\ntasks, and therefore it has the same shortcomings. This being said, our approach is a more direct way\\nto probe complex reasoning inside pre-trained LLMs, removing the confounding factor of in-context\\nlearning in prior few-shot approaches, and can lead to more unbiased study of biases in LLMs.\\n6\\nConclusion\\nWe have proposed Zero-shot-CoT, a single zero-shot prompt that elicits chain of thought from large\\nlanguage models across a variety of reasoning tasks, in contrast to the few-shot (in-context) approach\\nLarge Language Models are Zero-Shot Reasoners\\nTakeshi Kojima\\nThe University of Tokyo\\nt.kojima@weblab.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp\\nShixiang Shane Gu\\nGoogle Research, Brain Team\\nMachel Reid\\nGoogle Research∗\\nYutaka Matsuo\\nThe University of Tokyo\\nYusuke Iwasawa\\nThe University of Tokyo\\nAbstract\\nPretrained large language models (LLMs) are widely used in many sub-fields of\\nnatural language processing (NLP) and generally known as excellent few-shot\\nlearners with task-specific exemplars. Notably, chain of thought (CoT) prompting,\\na recent technique for eliciting complex multi-step reasoning through step-bystep answer examples, achieved the state-of-the-art performances in arithmetics\\nand symbolic reasoning, difficult system-2 tasks that do not follow the standard\\nscaling laws for LLMs. While these successes are often attributed to LLMs’\\nability for few-shot learning, we show that LLMs are decent zero-shot reasoners\\nby simply adding “Let’s think step by step” before each answer. Experimental\\nbenchmarks (MultiArith and GSM8K) across Zero-shot-CoT and baselines. The large gap between\\nstandard prompting (1st block) and chain of thought prompting (2nd block) suggests that these\\ntasks are difficult without eliciting multi-step reasoning. Major improvements are confirmed on\\nboth Instruct GPT-3 (text-davinci-002) and PaLM (540B) models (4th block). While Zero-shot-CoT\\nnaturally underperforms Few-shot-CoT, it substantially outperforms standard Few-shot prompting\\nwith even 8 examples per task. For GSM8K, Zero-shot-CoT with Instruct GPT-3 (text-davinci-002)\\nalso outperforms finetuned GPT-3 and standard few-shot prompting with large models (PaLM, 540B),\\nreported in Wei et al.

His mass-energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from relativity theory, has been called 'the world's most famous equation'. He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics 'for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect', a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science.

In summary, Few-shot-CoT [Wei et al., 2022] requires careful human engineering of\\na few prompt examples with specific answer formats per task, while Zero-shot-CoT requires less\\nengineering but requires prompting LLMs twice.\\n1st prompt: reasoning extraction\\nIn this step we first modify the input question x into a prompt\\nx′ using a simple template “Q: [X]. A: [T]”, where [X] is an input slot for x and [T] is an slot\\nfor hand-crafted trigger sentence t that would extract chain of though to answer the question x. For\\nexample, if we use “Let’s think step by step” as a trigger sentence, the prompt x′ would be “Q: [X].\\nA: Let’s think step by step.”. See Table 4 for more trigger examples. Prompted text x′ is then fed into\\na language model and generate subsequent sentence z. We can use any decoding strategy, but we\\nused greedy decoding throughout the paper for the simplicity.\\n2nd prompt: answer extraction\\nof thought, and large-scale models clearly demonstrate better reasoning (See Appendix B for the\\nsampled outputs for each model).\\nError Analysis\\nTo better understand the behavior of Zero-shot-CoT, we manually investigated\\nrandomly selected examples generated by Instruct-GPT3 with Zero-shot-CoT prompting. See Appendix C for examples, where some of the observations include: (1) In commonsense reasoning\\n(CommonsenseQA), Zero-shot-CoT often produces flexible and reasonable chain of thought even\\nwhen the final prediction is not correct. Zero-shot-CoT often output multiple answer choices when\\nthe model find it is difficult to narrow it down to one (see Table 3 for examples). (2) In arithmetic\\n7\\nreasoning (MultiArith), Zero-shot-CoT and Few-shot-CoT show substantial differences regarding\\nthe error patterns. First, Zero-shot-CoT tends to output unnecessary steps of reasoning after getting\\nthe correct prediction, which results in changing the prediction to incorrect one. Zero-shot-CoT also\\nsometimes does not start reasoning, just rephrasing the input question. In contrast, Few-shot-CoT\\ntend to fail when generated chain of thought include ternary operation, e.g. (3 + 2) ∗4.\\nHow does prompt selection affect Zero-shot-CoT?\\nWe validate the robustness of Zero-shot-CoT\\nagainst input prompts. Table 4 summarizes performance using 16 different templates with three\\ncategories. Specifically, following Webson and Pavlick [2022], the categories include instructive\\n(encourage reasoning), misleading (discourage reasoning or encouraging reasoning but in a wrong\\nway), and irrelevant (nothing to do with reasoning). The results indicate that the performance is\\ndeterministic. For the few-shot approaches, since the order of in-context examples could affect the\\nresults [Lu et al., 2022], we run each experiment only once with a fixed seed across all methods and\\ndatasets, for fair comparisons with the zero-shot methods. Wei et al. [2022] showed that the order of\\nexamples did not cause large variance in CoT experiments.\\nAnswer cleansing\\nAfter the model outputs a text by answer extraction (see § 3 and Figure 2), our\\nmethod picks up only the part of the answer text that first satisfies the answer format. For example,\\nif the answer prompting outputs “probably 375 and 376” on arithmetic tasks, we extract the first\\nnumber “375” and set it as the model prediction. In the case of multiple-choice, the first large letter\\nwe encounter is set as the prediction. See Appendix A.6 for more detail. Standard Zero-shot method\\nfollows the same idea. For Few-shot and Few-shot-CoT methods, we follow [Wang et al., 2022] and\",\n",
      "    \"answer\": \"The Zero-shot-CoT method for reasoning and answer extraction involves two stages: reasoning extraction and answer extraction. In the reasoning extraction stage, the input question is modified into a prompt using a template. The prompt is fed into a language model to generate a subsequent sentence. In the answer extraction stage, the generated sentence and the prompted sentence are used to extract the final answer from the language model. The prompt for this stage is self-augmented, as it contains the sentence generated by the same language model. The language model is then fed the prompted text to generate sentences and parse the final answer.\"\n",

Chain of thought\\n(CoT) prompting [Wei et al., 2022], an instance of few-shot prompting, proposed a simple solution\\nby modifying the answers in few-shot examples to step-by-step answers, and achieved significant\\nboosts in performance across these difficult benchmarks, especially when combined with very large\\nlanguage models like PaLM [Chowdhery et al., 2022]. The top row of Figure 1 shows standard\\nfew-shot prompting against (few-shot) CoT prompting. Notably, few-shot learning was taken as a\\ngiven for tackling such difficult tasks, and the zero-shot baseline performances were not even reported\\nin the original work [Wei et al., 2022]. To differentiate it from our method, we call Wei et al. [2022]\\nas Few-shot-CoT in this work.\\n3\\nZero-shot Chain of Thought\\nconfirm that it is not specially engineered for multi-step reasoning.\\nLimitation and Social Impact\\nOur work is based on prompting methods for large language models.\\nLLMs have been trained on large corpora from various sources on the web (also see “Training Dataset\\nDetails”), and have shown to capture and amplify biases found in the training data. Prompting is a\\nmethod that looks to take advantage of the patterns captured by language models conducive to various\\ntasks, and therefore it has the same shortcomings. This being said, our approach is a more direct way\\nto probe complex reasoning inside pre-trained LLMs, removing the confounding factor of in-context\\nlearning in prior few-shot approaches, and can lead to more unbiased study of biases in LLMs.\\n6\\nConclusion\\nWe have proposed Zero-shot-CoT, a single zero-shot prompt that elicits chain of thought from large\\nlanguage models across a variety of reasoning tasks, in contrast to the few-shot (in-context) approach\\nLarge Language Models are Zero-Shot Reasoners\\nTakeshi Kojima\\nThe University of Tokyo\\nt.kojima@weblab.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp\\nShixiang Shane Gu\\nGoogle Research, Brain Team\\nMachel Reid\\nGoogle Research∗\\nYutaka Matsuo\\nThe University of Tokyo\\nYusuke Iwasawa\\nThe University of Tokyo\\nAbstract\\nPretrained large language models (LLMs) are widely used in many sub-fields of\\nnatural language processing (NLP) and generally known as excellent few-shot\\nlearners with task-specific exemplars. Notably, chain of thought (CoT) prompting,\\na recent technique for eliciting complex multi-step reasoning through step-bystep answer examples, achieved the state-of-the-art performances in arithmetics\\nand symbolic reasoning, difficult system-2 tasks that do not follow the standard\\nscaling laws for LLMs. While these successes are often attributed to LLMs’\\nability for few-shot learning, we show that LLMs are decent zero-shot reasoners\\nby simply adding “Let’s think step by step” before each answer. Experimental\\nbenchmarks (MultiArith and GSM8K) across Zero-shot-CoT and baselines. The large gap between\\nstandard prompting (1st block) and chain of thought prompting (2nd block) suggests that these\\ntasks are difficult without eliciting multi-step reasoning. Major improvements are confirmed on\\nboth Instruct GPT-3 (text-davinci-002) and PaLM (540B) models (4th block). While Zero-shot-CoT\\nnaturally underperforms Few-shot-CoT, it substantially outperforms standard Few-shot prompting\\nwith even 8 examples per task. For GSM8K, Zero-shot-CoT with Instruct GPT-3 (text-davinci-002)\\nalso outperforms finetuned GPT-3 and standard few-shot prompting with large models (PaLM, 540B),\\nreported in Wei et al. [2022] (3rd and 4th block).

In summary, Few-shot-CoT [Wei et al., 2022] requires careful human engineering of\\na few prompt examples with specific answer formats per task, while Zero-shot-CoT requires less\\nengineering but requires prompting LLMs twice.\\n1st prompt: reasoning extraction\\nIn this step we first modify the input question x into a prompt\\nx′ using a simple template “Q: [X]. A: [T]”, where [X] is an input slot for x and [T] is an slot\\nfor hand-crafted trigger sentence t that would extract chain of though to answer the question x. For\\nexample, if we use “Let’s think step by step” as a trigger sentence, the prompt x′ would be “Q: [X].\\nA: Let’s think step by step.”. See Table 4 for more trigger examples. Prompted text x′ is then fed into\\na language model and generate subsequent sentence z. We can use any decoding strategy, but we\\nused greedy decoding throughout the paper for the simplicity.\\n2nd prompt: answer extraction\\nof thought, and large-scale models clearly demonstrate better reasoning (See Appendix B for the\\nsampled outputs for each model).\\nError Analysis\\nTo better understand the behavior of Zero-shot-CoT, we manually investigated\\nrandomly selected examples generated by Instruct-GPT3 with Zero-shot-CoT prompting. See Appendix C for examples, where some of the observations include: (1) In commonsense reasoning\\n(CommonsenseQA), Zero-shot-CoT often produces flexible and reasonable chain of thought even\\nwhen the final prediction is not correct. Zero-shot-CoT often output multiple answer choices when\\nthe model find it is difficult to narrow it down to one (see Table 3 for examples). (2) In arithmetic\\n7\\nreasoning (MultiArith), Zero-shot-CoT and Few-shot-CoT show substantial differences regarding\\nthe error patterns. First, Zero-shot-CoT tends to output unnecessary steps of reasoning after getting\\nthe correct prediction, which results in changing the prediction to incorrect one. Zero-shot-CoT also\\nsometimes does not start reasoning, just rephrasing the input question. In contrast, Few-shot-CoT\\ntend to fail when generated chain of thought include ternary operation, e.g. (3 + 2) ∗4.\\nHow does prompt selection affect Zero-shot-CoT?\\nWe validate the robustness of Zero-shot-CoT\\nagainst input prompts. Table 4 summarizes performance using 16 different templates with three\\ncategories. Specifically, following Webson and Pavlick [2022], the categories include instructive\\n(encourage reasoning), misleading (discourage reasoning or encouraging reasoning but in a wrong\\nway), and irrelevant (nothing to do with reasoning). The results indicate that the performance is\\ndeterministic. For the few-shot approaches, since the order of in-context examples could affect the\\nresults [Lu et al., 2022], we run each experiment only once with a fixed seed across all methods and\\ndatasets, for fair comparisons with the zero-shot methods. Wei et al. [2022] showed that the order of\\nexamples did not cause large variance in CoT experiments.\\nAnswer cleansing\\nAfter the model outputs a text by answer extraction (see § 3 and Figure 2), our\\nmethod picks up only the part of the answer text that first satisfies the answer format. For example,\\nif the answer prompting outputs “probably 375 and 376” on arithmetic tasks, we extract the first\\nnumber “375” and set it as the model prediction. In the case of multiple-choice, the first large letter\\nwe encounter is set as the prediction. See Appendix A.6 for more detail. Standard Zero-shot method\\nfollows the same idea. For Few-shot and Few-shot-CoT methods, we follow [Wang et al., 2022] and\",\n",

      "    \"context\": \"slow and multi-step reasoning [Rae et al., 2021]. To address this shortcoming, Wei et al. [2022],\\nWang et al. [2022] have proposed chain of thought prompting (CoT), which feed LLMs with the\\nstep-by-step reasoning examples rather than standard question and answer examples (see Fig. 1-a).\\nSuch chain of thought demonstrations facilitate models to generate a reasoning path that decomposes\\nthe complex reasoning into multiple easier steps. Notably with CoT, the reasoning performance then\\nsatisfies the scaling laws better and jumps up with the size of the language models. For example,\\nwhen combined with the 540B parameter PaLM model [Chowdhery et al., 2022], chain of thought\\nprompting significantly increases the performance over standard few-shot prompting across several\\nbenchmark reasoning tasks, e.g., GSM8K (17.9% →58.1%).\\nWhile the successes of CoT prompting [Wei et al., 2022], along those of many other task-specific\\nAUTOMATIC CHAIN OF THOUGHT PROMPTING\\nIN LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS\\nZhuosheng Zhang†∗, Aston Zhang‡, Mu Li‡, Alex Smola‡\\n†Shanghai Jiao Tong University, ‡Amazon Web Services\\nABSTRACT\\nLarge language models (LLMs) can perform complex reasoning by generating intermediate reasoning\\nsteps. Providing these steps for prompting demonstrations is called chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting.\\nCoT prompting has two major paradigms. One leverages a simple prompt like “Let’s think step by\\nstep” to facilitate step-by-step thinking before answering a question. The other uses a few manual\\ndemonstrations one by one, each composed of a question and a reasoning chain that leads to an\\nanswer. The superior performance of the second paradigm hinges on the hand-crafting of task-specific\\ndemonstrations one by one. We show that such manual efforts may be eliminated by leveraging\\nLLMs with the “Let’s think step by step” prompt to generate reasoning chains for demonstrations one\\nmulti-step reasoning and in-context learning for inducing LLMs to learn from demonstrations.\\n2.1\\nChain-of-thought Prompting\\nCoT prompting is a gradient-free technique of inducing LLMs to produce intermediate reasoning steps that lead to the\\nfinal answer. Wei et al. [2022a] formally studied the topic of CoT prompting in language models. This technique elicits\\nLLMs to generate a coherent series of intermediate reasoning steps that lead to the final answer to a question. Studies\\nhave shown that LLMs can perform CoT reasoning with zero-shot prompting (Zero-Shot-CoT) [Kojima et al., 2022] or\\nmanually written few-shot demonstrations (Manual-CoT) [Wei et al., 2022a].\\nZero-Shot-CoT.\\nKojima et al. [2022] showed that LLMs are decent zero-shot reasoners whose generated rationales\\nhave already reflected the CoT reasoning. This finding inspires our work to leverage the self-generated rationales for\\nimproving model interpretability (Zhou et al., 2020; Wiegreffe and Marasovi´c, 2021, inter alia). That\\nline of work typically focuses on natural language inference (Camburu et al., 2018; Yordanov et al.,\\n2021; Bostrom et al., 2021), and produces explanations either simultaneously to or after the final\\nprediction (Narang et al., 2020; Majumder et al., 2021; Wiegreffe et al., 2021, 2022). By contrast,\\nthe chain of thought processing considered in this paper occurs before the final answer. And while\\nNLE aims mostly to improve neural network interpretability (Rajagopal et al., 2021), the goal of\\nchain-of-thought prompting is to allow models to decompose multi-hop reasoning tasks into multiple\\nsteps—interpretability is just a side effect. Marasovi´c et al. (2022) show that prompt-based finetuning\\nwith NLE improves NLI and classification performance, though they largely focus on evaluating\\nexplanation plausibility. In comparison, our work focuses on a range of arithmetic, commonsense,\",\n",

His mass-energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from relativity theory, has been called 'the world's most famous equation'. He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics 'for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect', a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. In a 1999 poll of 130 leading physicists worldwide by the British journal Physics World, Einstein was ranked the greatest physicist of all time.

As in Table 4, the Codex LLM leads to performance improvement for Manual-CoT when compared\\nwith Table 3 that uses the GPT-3 (text-davinci-002) LLM. Nonetheless, using the Codex LLM, the overall performance\\nof Auto-CoT is still competitive compared to Manual-CoT, providing additional empirical evidence for the effectiveness\\nof Auto-CoT.\\n5.5\\nEffect of Wrong Demonstrations\\nRecall our discussions in Section 3.3 that there can be wrong demonstrations (whose answers are wrong). To see if\\ndiversity mitigates this effect, we design an In-Cluster Sampling baseline that constructs demonstrations by randomly\\nsampling questions from the same cluster that contains a test question. Figure 6 compares accuracy with varying\\nthe effect of misleading by similarity (Section 3.1). On the other hand, if we took each demonstration as a kind of skill,\\ndiverse demonstrations seem to cover more alternative skills for solving target questions: even though there still exists\\na small portion (e.g., 1/8) of mistakes in the demonstrations, the performance will not be negatively affected (to be\\nshown in Figure 6).\\nNevertheless, the clustering-based sampling method may still construct a small portion of wrong demonstrations, such\\nas from questions in the frequent-error cluster. As we will show later, some of these wrong demonstrations may be\\neliminated with heuristics. For example, wrong demonstrations often come with long questions and long rationales.\\nUsing simple and generic heuristics, such as only considering shorter questions with shorter rationales, further helps\\nmitigate the effect of imperfect Zero-Shot-CoT capabilities (Appendix C.2).\\n4\\nAuto-CoT: Automatic Chain-of-Thought Prompting\\nsampling questions from the same cluster that contains a test question. Figure 6 compares accuracy with varying\\namounts of wrong demonstrations on MultiArith. Compared with In-Cluster Sampling, Auto-CoT (using diversity-based\\nclustering) is less affected by wrong demonstrations: its performance still does not degrade significantly even when\\npresented with 50% wrong demonstrations.\\n12.5%\\n25.0%\\n37.5%\\n50.0%\\n80\\n85\\n90\\n95\\n100\\nPercentage of wrong demonstrations\\nAccuracy (%)\\nIn-Cluster Sampling\\nAuto-CoT\\nFigure 6: Effect of wrong demonstrations.\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n60\\n70\\n80\\n90\\n100\\nBatch\\nAccuracy (%)\\nZero-Shot-CoT\\nManual-CoT\\nAuto-CoT*\\nFigure 7: Bootstraping for the streaming setting.\\n5.6\\nMore Challenging Streaming Setting\\nCoT studies commonly assume that a full dataset with test questions is given [Wei et al., 2022a, Kojima et al., 2022].\\nBased on the given dataset, Auto-CoT samples questions to construct the demonstrations.

[2022] have proposed chain of thought prompting (CoT), which feed LLMs with the\\nstep-by-step reasoning examples rather than standard question and answer examples (see Fig. 1-a).\\nSuch chain of thought demonstrations facilitate models to generate a reasoning path that decomposes\\nthe complex reasoning into multiple easier steps. Notably with CoT, the reasoning performance then\\nsatisfies the scaling laws better and jumps up with the size of the language models. For example,\\nwhen combined with the 540B parameter PaLM model [Chowdhery et al., 2022], chain of thought\\nprompting significantly increases the performance over standard few-shot prompting across several\\nbenchmark reasoning tasks, e.g., GSM8K (17.9% →58.1%).\\nWhile the successes of CoT prompting [Wei et al., 2022], along those of many other task-specific\\nAUTOMATIC CHAIN OF THOUGHT PROMPTING\\nIN LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS\\nZhuosheng Zhang†∗, Aston Zhang‡, Mu Li‡, Alex Smola‡\\n†Shanghai Jiao Tong University, ‡Amazon Web Services\\nABSTRACT\\nLarge language models (LLMs) can perform complex reasoning by generating intermediate reasoning\\nsteps. Providing these steps for prompting demonstrations is called chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting.\\nCoT prompting has two major paradigms. One leverages a simple prompt like “Let’s think step by\\nstep” to facilitate step-by-step thinking before answering a question. The other uses a few manual\\ndemonstrations one by one, each composed of a question and a reasoning chain that leads to an\\nanswer. The superior performance of the second paradigm hinges on the hand-crafting of task-specific\\ndemonstrations one by one. We show that such manual efforts may be eliminated by leveraging\\nLLMs with the “Let’s think step by step” prompt to generate reasoning chains for demonstrations one\\nmulti-step reasoning and in-context learning for inducing LLMs to learn from demonstrations.\\n2.1\\nChain-of-thought Prompting\\nCoT prompting is a gradient-free technique of inducing LLMs to produce intermediate reasoning steps that lead to the\\nfinal answer. Wei et al. [2022a] formally studied the topic of CoT prompting in language models. This technique elicits\\nLLMs to generate a coherent series of intermediate reasoning steps that lead to the final answer to a question. Studies\\nhave shown that LLMs can perform CoT reasoning with zero-shot prompting (Zero-Shot-CoT) [Kojima et al., 2022] or\\nmanually written few-shot demonstrations (Manual-CoT) [Wei et al., 2022a].\\nZero-Shot-CoT.\\nKojima et al. [2022] showed that LLMs are decent zero-shot reasoners whose generated rationales\\nhave already reflected the CoT reasoning. This finding inspires our work to leverage the self-generated rationales for\\nimproving model interpretability (Zhou et al., 2020; Wiegreffe and Marasovi´c, 2021, inter alia). That\\nline of work typically focuses on natural language inference (Camburu et al., 2018; Yordanov et al.,\\n2021; Bostrom et al., 2021), and produces explanations either simultaneously to or after the final\\nprediction (Narang et al., 2020; Majumder et al., 2021; Wiegreffe et al., 2021, 2022). By contrast,\\nthe chain of thought processing considered in this paper occurs before the final answer. And while\\nNLE aims mostly to improve neural network interpretability (Rajagopal et al., 2021), the goal of\\nchain-of-thought prompting is to allow models to decompose multi-hop reasoning tasks into multiple\\nsteps—interpretability is just a side effect. Marasovi´c et al. (2022) show that prompt-based finetuning\\nwith NLE improves NLI and classification performance, though they largely focus on evaluating\\nexplanation plausibility. In comparison, our work focuses on a range of arithmetic, commonsense,\",\n",

His mass-energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from relativity theory, has been called 'the world's most famous equation'. He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics 'for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect', a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. In a 1999 poll of 130 leading physicists worldwide by the British journal Physics World, Einstein was ranked the greatest physicist of all time.

There is no shortage\\nof work showing that prompts affect language models in unexpected ways (Min et al., 2022). The\\ngeneral way that we created chain of thought annotations was by taking eight exemplars from the\\ntraining set and decomposing the reasoning process into multiple steps leading to the final answer.\\nExamples of chain of thought annotations are provided in Figure 3, with full prompts given in\\nAppendix G. To analyze how sensitive chain of thought is to prompt engineering, we performed\\nrobustness experiments with respect to various factors.\\n• Different annotators. We first analyze robustness to three different annotators (Section 3.4 and\\ndid not lead to significant gains (e.g., increasing from 8 to 16 exemplars did not improve the\\nperformance of standard prompting enough to catch up with chain-of-thought prompting).\\n• Different language models. Another interesting question is whether certain prompts that work\\nbetter for one model work better for other large language models. We find that with the same\\nprompts, chain-of-thought prompting improves performance across all three models (LaMDA,\\nGPT-3, and PaLM) for all datasets except CSQA and StrategyQA for GPT-3 (Table 1, Table 4,\\nTable 5). The fact that gains from chain of thought did not transfer perfectly among models is\\na limitation; further work could investigate why how different pre-training datasets and model\\narchitectures affect the performance gain from chain-of-thought prompting.\\nPrompt engineering still matters, though. Although the results are relatively robust to the prompt\\n2020, Thoppilan et al., 2022, Rae et al., 2021, Chowdhery et al., 2022]. The success of large language\\nmodels (LLMs) is often attributed to (in-context) few-shot or zero-shot learning. It can solve various\\ntasks by simply conditioning the models on a few examples (few-shot) or instructions describing the\\ntask (zero-shot). The method of conditioning the language model is called “prompting” [Liu et al.,\\n2021b], and designing prompts either manually [Schick and Schütze, 2021, Reynolds and McDonell,\\n2021] or automatically [Gao et al., 2021, Shin et al., 2020] has become a hot topic in NLP.\\n∗Work done while at The University of Tokyo.\\n36th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2022).\\narXiv:2205.11916v4  [cs.CL]  29 Jan 2023\\nStandard prompting\\n21.5 ±0.6\\n59.5 ±3.0\\n80.8 ±1.8\\n5.8 ±0.6\\n49.0 ±2.1\\nChain of thought prompting\\n26.8 ±2.1\\n85.8 ±1.8\\n91.7 ±1.4\\n77.5 ±3.8\\n99.6 ±0.3\\nAblations\\n· variable compute only\\n21.3 ±0.7\\n61.6 ±2.2\\n74.2 ±2.3\\n7.2 ±1.6\\n50.7 ±0.7\\n· reasoning after answer\\n20.9 ±1.0\\n63.0 ±2.0\\n83.3 ±0.6\\n0.0 ±0.0\\n50.2 ±0.5\\nRobustness\\n· different annotator (B)\\n27.4 ±1.7\\n75.4 ±2.7\\n88.3 ±1.4\\n76.0 ±1.9\\n77.5 ±7.9\\n· different annotator (C)\\n25.5 ±2.5\\n81.1 ±3.6\\n85.0 ±1.8\\n68.1 ±2.2\\n71.4 ±11.1\\n23\",\n",
      "    \"answer\": \"Our work is based on prompting methods for large language models. LLMs have been trained on large corpora from various sources on the web (also see “Training Dataset Details”), and have shown to capture and amplify biases found in the training data. Prompting is a method that looks to take advantage of the patterns captured by language models conducive to various tasks, and therefore it has the same shortcomings. This being said, our approach is a more direct way to probe complex reasoning inside pre-trained LLMs, removing the confounding factor of in-context learning in prior few-shot approaches, and can lead to more unbiased study of biases in LLMs.\"\n",

As in Table 4, the Codex LLM leads to performance improvement for Manual-CoT when compared\\nwith Table 3 that uses the GPT-3 (text-davinci-002) LLM. Nonetheless, using the Codex LLM, the overall performance\\nof Auto-CoT is still competitive compared to Manual-CoT, providing additional empirical evidence for the effectiveness\\nof Auto-CoT.\\n5.5\\nEffect of Wrong Demonstrations\\nRecall our discussions in Section 3.3 that there can be wrong demonstrations (whose answers are wrong). To see if\\ndiversity mitigates this effect, we design an In-Cluster Sampling baseline that constructs demonstrations by randomly\\nsampling questions from the same cluster that contains a test question. Figure 6 compares accuracy with varying\\nthe effect of misleading by similarity (Section 3.1). On the other hand, if we took each demonstration as a kind of skill,\\ndiverse demonstrations seem to cover more alternative skills for solving target questions: even though there still exists\\na small portion (e.g., 1/8) of mistakes in the demonstrations, the performance will not be negatively affected (to be\\nshown in Figure 6).\\nNevertheless, the clustering-based sampling method may still construct a small portion of wrong demonstrations, such\\nas from questions in the frequent-error cluster. As we will show later, some of these wrong demonstrations may be\\neliminated with heuristics. For example, wrong demonstrations often come with long questions and long rationales.\\nUsing simple and generic heuristics, such as only considering shorter questions with shorter rationales, further helps\\nmitigate the effect of imperfect Zero-Shot-CoT capabilities (Appendix C.2).\\n4\\nAuto-CoT: Automatic Chain-of-Thought Prompting\\nsampling questions from the same cluster that contains a test question. Figure 6 compares accuracy with varying\\namounts of wrong demonstrations on MultiArith.

Best known for developing the theory of relativity, he also made important contributions to quantum mechanics, and was thus a central figure in the revolutionary reshaping of the scientific understanding of nature that modern physics accomplished in the first decades of the twentieth century. His mass-energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from relativity theory, has been called 'the world's most famous equation'. He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics 'for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect', a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. In a 1999 poll of 130 leading physicists worldwide by the British journal Physics World, Einstein was ranked the greatest physicist of all time. His intellectual achievements and originality have made Einstein synonymous with genius.\",\n",

In summary, Few-shot-CoT [Wei et al., 2022] requires careful human engineering of\\na few prompt examples with specific answer formats per task, while Zero-shot-CoT requires less\\nengineering but requires prompting LLMs twice.\\n1st prompt: reasoning extraction\\nIn this step we first modify the input question x into a prompt\\nx′ using a simple template “Q: [X]. A: [T]”, where [X] is an input slot for x and [T] is an slot\\nfor hand-crafted trigger sentence t that would extract chain of though to answer the question x. For\\nexample, if we use “Let’s think step by step” as a trigger sentence, the prompt x′ would be “Q: [X].\\nA: Let’s think step by step.”. See Table 4 for more trigger examples. Prompted text x′ is then fed into\\na language model and generate subsequent sentence z. We can use any decoding strategy, but we\\nused greedy decoding throughout the paper for the simplicity.\\n2nd prompt: answer extraction\\nreasoning (MultiArith), Zero-shot-CoT and Few-shot-CoT show substantial differences regarding\\nthe error patterns. First, Zero-shot-CoT tends to output unnecessary steps of reasoning after getting\\nthe correct prediction, which results in changing the prediction to incorrect one. Zero-shot-CoT also\\nsometimes does not start reasoning, just rephrasing the input question. In contrast, Few-shot-CoT\\ntend to fail when generated chain of thought include ternary operation, e.g. (3 + 2) ∗4.\\nHow does prompt selection affect Zero-shot-CoT?\\nWe validate the robustness of Zero-shot-CoT\\nagainst input prompts. Table 4 summarizes performance using 16 different templates with three\\ncategories. Specifically, following Webson and Pavlick [2022], the categories include instructive\\n(encourage reasoning), misleading (discourage reasoning or encouraging reasoning but in a wrong\\nway), and irrelevant (nothing to do with reasoning). The results indicate that the performance is\\nof thought, and large-scale models clearly demonstrate better reasoning (See Appendix B for the\\nsampled outputs for each model).\\nError Analysis\\nTo better understand the behavior of Zero-shot-CoT, we manually investigated\\nrandomly selected examples generated by Instruct-GPT3 with Zero-shot-CoT prompting. See Appendix C for examples, where some of the observations include: (1) In commonsense reasoning\\n(CommonsenseQA), Zero-shot-CoT often produces flexible and reasonable chain of thought even\\nwhen the final prediction is not correct. Zero-shot-CoT often output multiple answer choices when\\nthe model find it is difficult to narrow it down to one (see Table 3 for examples).

There is no shortage\\nof work showing that prompts affect language models in unexpected ways (Min et al., 2022). The\\ngeneral way that we created chain of thought annotations was by taking eight exemplars from the\\ntraining set and decomposing the reasoning process into multiple steps leading to the final answer.\\nExamples of chain of thought annotations are provided in Figure 3, with full prompts given in\\nAppendix G. To analyze how sensitive chain of thought is to prompt engineering, we performed\\nrobustness experiments with respect to various factors.\\n• Different annotators. We first analyze robustness to three different annotators (Section 3.4 and\\ndid not lead to significant gains (e.g., increasing from 8 to 16 exemplars did not improve the\\nperformance of standard prompting enough to catch up with chain-of-thought prompting).\\n• Different language models. Another interesting question is whether certain prompts that work\\nbetter for one model work better for other large language models. We find that with the same\\nprompts, chain-of-thought prompting improves performance across all three models (LaMDA,\\nGPT-3, and PaLM) for all datasets except CSQA and StrategyQA for GPT-3 (Table 1, Table 4,\\nTable 5). The fact that gains from chain of thought did not transfer perfectly among models is\\na limitation; further work could investigate why how different pre-training datasets and model\\narchitectures affect the performance gain from chain-of-thought prompting.\\nPrompt engineering still matters, though. Although the results are relatively robust to the prompt\\n2020, Thoppilan et al., 2022, Rae et al., 2021, Chowdhery et al., 2022]. The success of large language\\nmodels (LLMs) is often attributed to (in-context) few-shot or zero-shot learning. It can solve various\\ntasks by simply conditioning the models on a few examples (few-shot) or instructions describing the\\ntask (zero-shot). The method of conditioning the language model is called “prompting” [Liu et al.,\\n2021b], and designing prompts either manually [Schick and Schütze, 2021, Reynolds and McDonell,\\n2021] or automatically [Gao et al., 2021, Shin et al., 2020] has become a hot topic in NLP.\\n∗Work done while at The University of Tokyo.\\n36th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2022).\\narXiv:2205.11916v4  [cs.CL]  29 Jan 2023\\nStandard prompting\\n21.5 ±0.6\\n59.5 ±3.0\\n80.8 ±1.8\\n5.8 ±0.6\\n49.0 ±2.1\\nChain of thought prompting\\n26.8 ±2.1\\n85.8 ±1.8\\n91.7 ±1.4\\n77.5 ±3.8\\n99.6 ±0.3\\nAblations\\n· variable compute only\\n21.3 ±0.7\\n61.6 ±2.2\\n74.2 ±2.3\\n7.2 ±1.6\\n50.7 ±0.7\\n· reasoning after answer\\n20.9 ±1.0\\n63.0 ±2.0\\n83.3 ±0.6\\n0.0 ±0.0\\n50.2 ±0.5\\nRobustness\\n· different annotator (B)\\n27.4 ±1.7\\n75.4 ±2.7\\n88.3 ±1.4\\n76.0 ±1.9\\n77.5 ±7.9\\n· different annotator (C)\\n25.5 ±2.5\\n81.1 ±3.6\\n85.0 ±1.8\\n68.1 ±2.2\\n71.4 ±11.1\\n23\",\n",

Best known for developing the theory of relativity, he also made important contributions to quantum mechanics, and was thus a central figure in the revolutionary reshaping of the scientific understanding of nature that modern physics accomplished in the first decades of the twentieth century. His mass-energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from relativity theory, has been called 'the world's most famous equation'. He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics 'for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect', a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. In a 1999 poll of 130 leading physicists worldwide by the British journal Physics World, Einstein was ranked the greatest physicist of all time. His intellectual achievements and originality have made Einstein synonymous with genius.\",\n",

In addition, we simultaneously explore the role of the number of instruction templates per\\ndataset; as mentioned in §2.1, for each dataset we manually composed ten instructional templates for\\ninstruction tuning. Here, we instruction tune models using 1, 4, and 10 templates per dataset.\\nFigure 11 shows these results. Using more datasets per cluster improved performance by almost\\n10% on average across the three held-out clusters. Using more templates per dataset, however,\\nhad a comparatively negligible effect on performance when there was one task per cluster, which\\ndisappeared when there were four tasks per cluster. The small effect of templates is striking given our\\noriginal motivation that composing ten templates per task would mitigate overfitting to any particular\\ntemplate. This results serves to underscore, however, the unpredictability of finetuning large language\\nmodels, as one hypothesis is that models at such scale do not easily overfit to a finetuning single task.\\nused in finetuning are 1024 and 256, respectively. We use packing (Raffel et al., 2020) to combine\\nmultiple training examples into a single sequence, separating inputs from targets using a special EOS\\ntoken. This instruction tuning takes around 60 hours on a TPUv3 with 128 cores. For all evaluations,\\nwe report results on the final checkpoint trained for 30k steps.\\n3\\nRESULTS\\nWe evaluate FLAN on natural language inference, reading comprehension, closed-book QA, translation, commonsense reasoning, coreference resolution, and struct-to-text. As described in §2.2, we\\nevaluate on unseen tasks by grouping datasets into task clusters and holding out each cluster for\\nevaluation while instruction tuning on all remaining clusters (i.e., each evaluation task cluster uses\\na different checkpoint). For each dataset, we evaluate the mean of performance on all templates,\\nwhich proxies the expected performance given a typical natural language instruction. As a dev set is\\ninstruction tuning could result in positive task transfer among seen tasks, depending on the mixture\\nof tasks (though we leave this for future work). In §4.5, where we apply prompt tuning to the FLAN\\ncheckpoint, we see promising results that indicate positive task transfer in a supervised setting.\\nAre the ten unique templates per dataset or per task cluster?\\nThe ten unique templates are for each dataset and not for a task cluster. This is because datasets in the\\nsame task cluster often differed slightly (e.g., “is this movie review positive” vs “is this yelp review\\npositive”).\\nIn Figure 7A, why does the untuned LaMDA-PT model see worse performance with more\\nparameters for reading comprehension and sentiment analysis?\\nFor context, Figure 7A is a check of correctness for Figure 7B. Figure 7A confirms that scale improves\\nperformance for tasks that were seen during instruction tuning, as expected. The untuned LaMDA-PT\\nmodel performance in Figure 7A is shown just for completeness.\\n30\",\n",

In summary, Few-shot-CoT [Wei et al., 2022] requires careful human engineering of\\na few prompt examples with specific answer formats per task, while Zero-shot-CoT requires less\\nengineering but requires prompting LLMs twice.\\n1st prompt: reasoning extraction\\nIn this step we first modify the input question x into a prompt\\nx′ using a simple template “Q: [X]. A: [T]”, where [X] is an input slot for x and [T] is an slot\\nfor hand-crafted trigger sentence t that would extract chain of though to answer the question x. For\\nexample, if we use “Let’s think step by step” as a trigger sentence, the prompt x′ would be “Q: [X].\\nA: Let’s think step by step.”. See Table 4 for more trigger examples. Prompted text x′ is then fed into\\na language model and generate subsequent sentence z. We can use any decoding strategy, but we\\nused greedy decoding throughout the paper for the simplicity.\\n2nd prompt: answer extraction\\nreasoning (MultiArith), Zero-shot-CoT and Few-shot-CoT show substantial differences regarding\\nthe error patterns. First, Zero-shot-CoT tends to output unnecessary steps of reasoning after getting\\nthe correct prediction, which results in changing the prediction to incorrect one. Zero-shot-CoT also\\nsometimes does not start reasoning, just rephrasing the input question. In contrast, Few-shot-CoT\\ntend to fail when generated chain of thought include ternary operation, e.g. (3 + 2) ∗4.\\nHow does prompt selection affect Zero-shot-CoT?\\nWe validate the robustness of Zero-shot-CoT\\nagainst input prompts. Table 4 summarizes performance using 16 different templates with three\\ncategories. Specifically, following Webson and Pavlick [2022], the categories include instructive\\n(encourage reasoning), misleading (discourage reasoning or encouraging reasoning but in a wrong\\nway), and irrelevant (nothing to do with reasoning). The results indicate that the performance is\\nof thought, and large-scale models clearly demonstrate better reasoning (See Appendix B for the\\nsampled outputs for each model).\\nError Analysis\\nTo better understand the behavior of Zero-shot-CoT, we manually investigated\\nrandomly selected examples generated by Instruct-GPT3 with Zero-shot-CoT prompting. See Appendix C for examples, where some of the observations include: (1) In commonsense reasoning\\n(CommonsenseQA), Zero-shot-CoT often produces flexible and reasonable chain of thought even\\nwhen the final prediction is not correct. Zero-shot-CoT often output multiple answer choices when\\nthe model find it is difficult to narrow it down to one (see Table 3 for examples).

In addition, we simultaneously explore the role of the number of instruction templates per\\ndataset; as mentioned in §2.1, for each dataset we manually composed ten instructional templates for\\ninstruction tuning. Here, we instruction tune models using 1, 4, and 10 templates per dataset.\\nFigure 11 shows these results. Using more datasets per cluster improved performance by almost\\n10% on average across the three held-out clusters. Using more templates per dataset, however,\\nhad a comparatively negligible effect on performance when there was one task per cluster, which\\ndisappeared when there were four tasks per cluster. The small effect of templates is striking given our\\noriginal motivation that composing ten templates per task would mitigate overfitting to any particular\\ntemplate. This results serves to underscore, however, the unpredictability of finetuning large language\\nmodels, as one hypothesis is that models at such scale do not easily overfit to a finetuning single task.\\nused in finetuning are 1024 and 256, respectively. We use packing (Raffel et al., 2020) to combine\\nmultiple training examples into a single sequence, separating inputs from targets using a special EOS\\ntoken. This instruction tuning takes around 60 hours on a TPUv3 with 128 cores. For all evaluations,\\nwe report results on the final checkpoint trained for 30k steps.\\n3\\nRESULTS\\nWe evaluate FLAN on natural language inference, reading comprehension, closed-book QA, translation, commonsense reasoning, coreference resolution, and struct-to-text. As described in §2.2, we\\nevaluate on unseen tasks by grouping datasets into task clusters and holding out each cluster for\\nevaluation while instruction tuning on all remaining clusters (i.e., each evaluation task cluster uses\\na different checkpoint). For each dataset, we evaluate the mean of performance on all templates,\\nwhich proxies the expected performance given a typical natural language instruction. As a dev set is\\ninstruction tuning could result in positive task transfer among seen tasks, depending on the mixture\\nof tasks (though we leave this for future work). In §4.5, where we apply prompt tuning to the FLAN\\ncheckpoint, we see promising results that indicate positive task transfer in a supervised setting.\\nAre the ten unique templates per dataset or per task cluster?\\nThe ten unique templates are for each dataset and not for a task cluster. This is because datasets in the\\nsame task cluster often differed slightly (e.g., “is this movie review positive” vs “is this yelp review\\npositive”).\\nIn Figure 7A, why does the untuned LaMDA-PT model see worse performance with more\\nparameters for reading comprehension and sentiment analysis?\\nFor context, Figure 7A is a check of correctness for Figure 7B. Figure 7A confirms that scale improves\\nperformance for tasks that were seen during instruction tuning, as expected. The untuned LaMDA-PT\\nmodel performance in Figure 7A is shown just for completeness.\\n30\",\n",

His mass-energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from relativity theory, has been called 'the world's most famous equation'. He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics 'for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect', a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science.

Using the same\\ncluster split as in the previous ablation study,\\nwe evaluate the effect of instruction tuning\\non models of size 422M, 2B, 8B, 68B, and\\n137B parameters.\\nFigure 7 shows these results.

(2020), Bender et al. (2021), Patterson et al., (2021), and others. As our\\ncontribution in this paper is not a pretrained language model itself but rather an empirical study of\\nhow instruction tuning affects the zero-shot performance of a language model on unseen tasks, we\\nadditionally highlight two relevant ethical considerations. First, labeled datasets such as those we\\nuse for finetuning can contain undesirable biases, and these biases can be propagated into zero-shot\\napplications of the model on downstream tasks. And second, instruction-tuned models can potentially\\nrequire less data and expertise to use; such lower barriers to access could increase both the benefits\\nand associated risks of such models.\\nENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS\\nDoes model size matter for zero-shot reasoning?\\nFigure 3 compares performance of various\\nlanguage models on MultiArith / GSM8K. Without chain of thought reasoning, the performance\\ndoes not increase or increases slowly as the model scale is increased, i.e., the curve is mostly flat. In\\ncontrast, the performance drastically increases with chain of thought reasoning, as the model size\\ngets bigger, for Original/Instruct GPT-3 and PaLM. When the model size is smaller, chain of thought\\nreasoning is not effective. This result aligns with the few-shot experiment results in Wei et al. [2022].\\nAppendix E shows extensive experiment results using wider variety of language models, including\\nGPT-2, GPT-Neo, GPT-J, T0, and OPT. We also manually investigated the quality of generated chain\\nof thought, and large-scale models clearly demonstrate better reasoning (See Appendix B for the\\nsampled outputs for each model).\\nError Analysis\\nbenchmarks (MultiArith and GSM8K) across Zero-shot-CoT and baselines. The large gap between\\nstandard prompting (1st block) and chain of thought prompting (2nd block) suggests that these\\ntasks are difficult without eliciting multi-step reasoning. Major improvements are confirmed on\\nboth Instruct GPT-3 (text-davinci-002) and PaLM (540B) models (4th block). While Zero-shot-CoT\\nnaturally underperforms Few-shot-CoT, it substantially outperforms standard Few-shot prompting\\nwith even 8 examples per task. For GSM8K, Zero-shot-CoT with Instruct GPT-3 (text-davinci-002)\\nalso outperforms finetuned GPT-3 and standard few-shot prompting with large models (PaLM, 540B),\\nreported in Wei et al.

      "    \"answer\": \"For larger language models on the order of 100B parameters, instruction tuning substantially improves performance on held-out tasks. However, for smaller models (8B and smaller), instruction tuning actually hurts performance on held-out tasks. One potential explanation for this result is that for small-scale models, learning the tasks used during instruction tuning fills the entire model capacity, causing these models to perform worse.\"\n",

Notably, chain of thought (CoT) prompting,\\na recent technique for eliciting complex multi-step reasoning through step-bystep answer examples, achieved the state-of-the-art performances in arithmetics\\nand symbolic reasoning, difficult system-2 tasks that do not follow the standard\\nscaling laws for LLMs. While these successes are often attributed to LLMs’\\nability for few-shot learning, we show that LLMs are decent zero-shot reasoners\\nby simply adding “Let’s think step by step” before each answer. Experimental\\nof training datasets used for LLMs, e.g. 001 vs 002 for GPT models, original GPT3 vs InstructGPT [Ouyang et al., 2022], and data for PaLM models [Chowdhery et al., 2022]. However, big\\nperformance increases from Zero-shot to Zero-shot-CoT in all recent large models (InstructGPT\\n001 or 002, Original GPT3, and PaLM) and consistent improvements in both arithmetic and nonarithmetic tasks suggest that the models are unlikely simply memorizing, but instead capturing a\\ntask-agnostic multi-step reasoning capability for generic problem solving. While most results are\\nbased on InstructGPT since it is the best performing open-access LLM, key results are reproduced\\non PaLM, and dataset details in InstructGPT (Appendix A, B, and F in Ouyang et al.

His mass-energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from relativity theory, has been called 'the world's most famous equation'. He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics 'for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect', a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science.

      "    \"context\": \"confirm that it is not specially engineered for multi-step reasoning.\\nLimitation and Social Impact\\nOur work is based on prompting methods for large language models.\\nLLMs have been trained on large corpora from various sources on the web (also see “Training Dataset\\nDetails”), and have shown to capture and amplify biases found in the training data. Prompting is a\\nmethod that looks to take advantage of the patterns captured by language models conducive to various\\ntasks, and therefore it has the same shortcomings. This being said, our approach is a more direct way\\nto probe complex reasoning inside pre-trained LLMs, removing the confounding factor of in-context\\nlearning in prior few-shot approaches, and can lead to more unbiased study of biases in LLMs.\\n6\\nConclusion\\nWe have proposed Zero-shot-CoT, a single zero-shot prompt that elicits chain of thought from large\\nlanguage models across a variety of reasoning tasks, in contrast to the few-shot (in-context) approach\\nFew-shot-CoT ([Wei et al., 2022]), (c) standard Zero-shot, and (d) ours (Zero-shot-CoT). Similar to\\nFew-shot-CoT, Zero-shot-CoT facilitates multi-step reasoning (blue text) and reach correct answer\\nwhere standard prompting fails. Unlike Few-shot-CoT using step-by-step reasoning examples per\\ntask, ours does not need any examples and just uses the same prompt “Let’s think step by step” across\\nall tasks (arithmetic, symbolic, commonsense, and other logical reasoning tasks).\\nIn contrast to the excellent performance of LLMs in intuitive and single-step system-1 [Stanovich\\nand West, 2000] tasks with task-specific few-shot or zero-shot prompting [Liu et al., 2021b], even\\nlanguage models at the scale of 100B or more parameters had struggled on system-2 tasks requiring\\nslow and multi-step reasoning [Rae et al., 2021]. To address this shortcoming, Wei et al. [2022],\\nWang et al. [2022] have proposed chain of thought prompting (CoT), which feed LLMs with the\\nChain of thought prompting\\nMulti-step arithmetic and logical reasoning benchmarks have particularly challenged the scaling laws of large language models [Rae et al., 2021]. Chain of thought\\n(CoT) prompting [Wei et al., 2022], an instance of few-shot prompting, proposed a simple solution\\nby modifying the answers in few-shot examples to step-by-step answers, and achieved significant\\nboosts in performance across these difficult benchmarks, especially when combined with very large\\nlanguage models like PaLM [Chowdhery et al., 2022]. The top row of Figure 1 shows standard\\nfew-shot prompting against (few-shot) CoT prompting. Notably, few-shot learning was taken as a\\ngiven for tackling such difficult tasks, and the zero-shot baseline performances were not even reported\\nin the original work [Wei et al., 2022]. To differentiate it from our method, we call Wei et al. [2022]\\nas Few-shot-CoT in this work.\\n3\\nZero-shot Chain of Thought\\nof training datasets used for LLMs, e.g. 001 vs 002 for GPT models, original GPT3 vs InstructGPT [Ouyang et al., 2022], and data for PaLM models [Chowdhery et al., 2022]. However, big\\nperformance increases from Zero-shot to Zero-shot-CoT in all recent large models (InstructGPT\\n001 or 002, Original GPT3, and PaLM) and consistent improvements in both arithmetic and nonarithmetic tasks suggest that the models are unlikely simply memorizing, but instead capturing a\\ntask-agnostic multi-step reasoning capability for generic problem solving. While most results are\\nbased on InstructGPT since it is the best performing open-access LLM, key results are reproduced\\non PaLM, and dataset details in InstructGPT (Appendix A, B, and F in Ouyang et al.

Using the same\\ncluster split as in the previous ablation study,\\nwe evaluate the effect of instruction tuning\\non models of size 422M, 2B, 8B, 68B, and\\n137B parameters.\\nFigure 7 shows these results. We see that\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2022\\nETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS\\nThis work uses language models, for which the risks and potential harms are discussed in Bender &\\nKoller (2020), Brown et al. (2020), Bender et al. (2021), Patterson et al., (2021), and others. As our\\ncontribution in this paper is not a pretrained language model itself but rather an empirical study of\\nhow instruction tuning affects the zero-shot performance of a language model on unseen tasks, we\\nadditionally highlight two relevant ethical considerations. First, labeled datasets such as those we\\nuse for finetuning can contain undesirable biases, and these biases can be propagated into zero-shot\\napplications of the model on downstream tasks. And second, instruction-tuned models can potentially\\nrequire less data and expertise to use; such lower barriers to access could increase both the benefits\\nand associated risks of such models.\\nENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS\\nDoes model size matter for zero-shot reasoning?\\nFigure 3 compares performance of various\\nlanguage models on MultiArith / GSM8K. Without chain of thought reasoning, the performance\\ndoes not increase or increases slowly as the model scale is increased, i.e., the curve is mostly flat. In\\ncontrast, the performance drastically increases with chain of thought reasoning, as the model size\\ngets bigger, for Original/Instruct GPT-3 and PaLM. When the model size is smaller, chain of thought\\nreasoning is not effective. This result aligns with the few-shot experiment results in Wei et al. [2022].\\nAppendix E shows extensive experiment results using wider variety of language models, including\\nGPT-2, GPT-Neo, GPT-J, T0, and OPT. We also manually investigated the quality of generated chain\\nof thought, and large-scale models clearly demonstrate better reasoning (See Appendix B for the\\nsampled outputs for each model).\\nError Analysis\\nbenchmarks (MultiArith and GSM8K) across Zero-shot-CoT and baselines. The large gap between\\nstandard prompting (1st block) and chain of thought prompting (2nd block) suggests that these\\ntasks are difficult without eliciting multi-step reasoning. Major improvements are confirmed on\\nboth Instruct GPT-3 (text-davinci-002) and PaLM (540B) models (4th block). While Zero-shot-CoT\\nnaturally underperforms Few-shot-CoT, it substantially outperforms standard Few-shot prompting\\nwith even 8 examples per task. For GSM8K, Zero-shot-CoT with Instruct GPT-3 (text-davinci-002)\\nalso outperforms finetuned GPT-3 and standard few-shot prompting with large models (PaLM, 540B),\\nreported in Wei et al.

Prompting is a\\nmethod that looks to take advantage of the patterns captured by language models conducive to various\\ntasks, and therefore it has the same shortcomings. This being said, our approach is a more direct way\\nto probe complex reasoning inside pre-trained LLMs, removing the confounding factor of in-context\\nlearning in prior few-shot approaches, and can lead to more unbiased study of biases in LLMs.\\n6\\nConclusion\\nWe have proposed Zero-shot-CoT, a single zero-shot prompt that elicits chain of thought from large\\nlanguage models across a variety of reasoning tasks, in contrast to the few-shot (in-context) approach\\nFew-shot-CoT ([Wei et al., 2022]), (c) standard Zero-shot, and (d) ours (Zero-shot-CoT). Similar to\\nFew-shot-CoT, Zero-shot-CoT facilitates multi-step reasoning (blue text) and reach correct answer\\nwhere standard prompting fails. Unlike Few-shot-CoT using step-by-step reasoning examples per\\ntask, ours does not need any examples and just uses the same prompt “Let’s think step by step” across\\nall tasks (arithmetic, symbolic, commonsense, and other logical reasoning tasks).\\nIn contrast to the excellent performance of LLMs in intuitive and single-step system-1 [Stanovich\\nand West, 2000] tasks with task-specific few-shot or zero-shot prompting [Liu et al., 2021b], even\\nlanguage models at the scale of 100B or more parameters had struggled on system-2 tasks requiring\\nslow and multi-step reasoning [Rae et al., 2021]. To address this shortcoming, Wei et al. [2022],\\nWang et al. [2022] have proposed chain of thought prompting (CoT), which feed LLMs with the\\nChain of thought prompting\\nMulti-step arithmetic and logical reasoning benchmarks have particularly challenged the scaling laws of large language models [Rae et al., 2021]. Chain of thought\\n(CoT) prompting [Wei et al., 2022], an instance of few-shot prompting, proposed a simple solution\\nby modifying the answers in few-shot examples to step-by-step answers, and achieved significant\\nboosts in performance across these difficult benchmarks, especially when combined with very large\\nlanguage models like PaLM [Chowdhery et al., 2022]. The top row of Figure 1 shows standard\\nfew-shot prompting against (few-shot) CoT prompting. Notably, few-shot learning was taken as a\\ngiven for tackling such difficult tasks, and the zero-shot baseline performances were not even reported\\nin the original work [Wei et al., 2022]. To differentiate it from our method, we call Wei et al. [2022]\\nas Few-shot-CoT in this work.\\n3\\nZero-shot Chain of Thought\\nof training datasets used for LLMs, e.g. 001 vs 002 for GPT models, original GPT3 vs InstructGPT [Ouyang et al., 2022], and data for PaLM models [Chowdhery et al., 2022]. However, big\\nperformance increases from Zero-shot to Zero-shot-CoT in all recent large models (InstructGPT\\n001 or 002, Original GPT3, and PaLM) and consistent improvements in both arithmetic and nonarithmetic tasks suggest that the models are unlikely simply memorizing, but instead capturing a\\ntask-agnostic multi-step reasoning capability for generic problem solving. While most results are\\nbased on InstructGPT since it is the best performing open-access LLM, key results are reproduced\\non PaLM, and dataset details in InstructGPT (Appendix A, B, and F in Ouyang et al.

His mass-energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from relativity theory, has been called 'the world's most famous equation'. He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics 'for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect', a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science.

Let us simply call demonstrations\\nwith wrong answers as wrong demonstrations. Intuitively, after similar questions to a test question are retrieved, wrong\\ndemonstrations caused by Zero-Shot-CoT may mislead the same LLM to reason similarly with a wrong answer (e.g.,\\nreplicating mistakes) for the test question.

His mass-energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from relativity theory, has been called 'the world's most famous equation'. He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics 'for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect', a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science.

      "    \"answer\": \"Prompting methods for large language models have both pros and cons in terms of bias and unbiased study. On one hand, these methods take advantage of the patterns captured by language models, which can amplify biases found in the training data. This means that the prompts may inherit and perpetuate biases present in the training data. On the other hand, prompting methods provide a more direct way to probe complex reasoning inside pre-trained language models, removing the confounding factor of in-context learning in prior few-shot approaches. This can lead to a more unbiased study of biases in language models. Overall, while prompting methods have the potential for bias, they also offer opportunities for unbiased exploration of language models.\"\n",

Among them, we collect those 128\\nquestions (denoted as Q) where Zero-Shot-CoT generates wrong\\nanswers (error rate: 21.3% = 128/600). As we mentioned, with\\nextra demonstrations, Retrieval-Q-CoT and Random-Q-CoT are\\nexpected to perform more competitively than Zero-Shot-CoT. Among\\nQ where Zero-Shot-CoT fails, we call those where Retrieval-Q-CoT\\nor Random-Q-CoT still fail as their unresolved questions. We divide\\nthe number of unresolved questions by 128 (number of questions in\\nQ) to calculate the unresolving rate. A higher unresolving rate means\\nthat a method more likely still makes mistakes like Zero-Shot-CoT.\\nFigure 2 shows that the unresolving rate of Retrieval-Q-CoT (46.9%)\\nOn a high level, both Retrieval-Q-CoT and Random-Q-CoT take the concatenation of qdemo\\ni\\n, cdemo\\ni\\npairs (i = 1, . . . , k)\\nand qtest as input to predict the reasoning chain for qtest, which contains the answer in the end (like right of Figure 1).\\nTable 1: Accuracy (%) of different sampling\\nmethods.

Note that the retrieval methods were originally proposed in\\ntasks with annotated labels [Rubin et al., 2022, Su et al., 2022],\\nhowever, invoking Zero-Shot-CoT does not guarantee entirely correct\\nreasoning chains. Thus, we hypothesize that the inferior performance\\nthat a method more likely still makes mistakes like Zero-Shot-CoT.\\nFigure 2 shows that the unresolving rate of Retrieval-Q-CoT (46.9%)\\nis much higher than Random-Q-CoT (25.8%). It indicates that with similar questions being sampled for test questions,\\nRetrieval-Q-CoT is negatively affected by misleading by similarity.\\nTo show that unresolved questions of Retrieval-Q-CoT tend to be similar, we present a case study in Table 2. In the left\\npart, the retrieved demonstration questions are similar to the test question and ask “how long will it take him to cook the\\nrest?” The reasoning chains generated by Zero-Shot-CoT produce answers regarding “the total of” instead of “the rest”.\\nFollowing the demonstrations, Retrieval-Q-CoT also fails by misunderstanding the meaning of “the rest”. In contrast,\\nRandom-Q-CoT correctly understands “the rest” better without making similar mistakes in the demonstrations, thanks\\nto relatively more diverse (random) demonstrations.\\n3.2\\naddressed. To design more effective Auto-CoT, we need to understand its challenge better.\\n3.1\\nRetrieval-Q-CoT Fails due to Misleading by Similarity\\nSince Retrieval-Q-CoT uses a few prompting demonstrations like in Manual-CoT, Retrieval-Q-CoT is expected to\\nperform competitively as well. However, reasoning chains (both rationales and answers) in Retrieval-Q-CoT are\\ngenerated by Zero-Shot-CoT: they may have mistakes that lead to wrong answers. Let us simply call demonstrations\\nwith wrong answers as wrong demonstrations. Intuitively, after similar questions to a test question are retrieved, wrong\\ndemonstrations caused by Zero-Shot-CoT may mislead the same LLM to reason similarly with a wrong answer (e.g.,\\nreplicating mistakes) for the test question. We refer to this phenomenon as misleading by similarity. We will investigate\\nwhether misleading by similarity contributes to the inferior performance of Retrieval-Q-CoT.\\nRetrieval-Q-CoT\\nRandom-Q-CoT\\n20\\n30\\n40\\n50\\nRate (%)\",\n",

His mass-energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from relativity theory, has been called 'the world's most famous equation'. He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics 'for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect', a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. In a 1999 poll of 130 leading physicists worldwide by the British journal Physics World, Einstein was ranked the greatest physicist of all time.

We shuffle either of\\nthe demonstration components to see how the performance changes. According to the results in Table 5, shuffling\\nquestions has the least performance reduction (91.7% →73.8%). A possible reason for the decent performance is that\\nthe model may capture the rationale-answer mapping patterns. The pattern is expected to reflect how the intermediate\\nreasoning steps can lead to the final answer. This finding shows that it is possible to leverage the generated rationales\\nby Zero-Shot-CoT because those rationales are often logically correct even though they may lead to wrong answers\\n[Kojima et al., 2022].\\nTable 5: Impact of different components in the demonstrations.\\nMethod\\nAccuracy\\nManual-CoT\\n91.7\\nShuffle Questions\\n73.8\\nShuffle Rationales\\n43.8\\nShuffle Answers\\n17.0\\nExperimental results on ten public benchmark reasoning datasets showed that with GPT-3, Auto-CoT consistently\\nmatches or exceeds the performance of the CoT paradigm that requires manual designs of demonstrations.\\n9\\nthe effect of misleading by similarity (Section 3.1). On the other hand, if we took each demonstration as a kind of skill,\\ndiverse demonstrations seem to cover more alternative skills for solving target questions: even though there still exists\\na small portion (e.g., 1/8) of mistakes in the demonstrations, the performance will not be negatively affected (to be\\nshown in Figure 6).\\nNevertheless, the clustering-based sampling method may still construct a small portion of wrong demonstrations, such\\nas from questions in the frequent-error cluster. As we will show later, some of these wrong demonstrations may be\\neliminated with heuristics. For example, wrong demonstrations often come with long questions and long rationales.\\nUsing simple and generic heuristics, such as only considering shorter questions with shorter rationales, further helps\\nmitigate the effect of imperfect Zero-Shot-CoT capabilities (Appendix C.2).\\n4\\nAuto-CoT: Automatic Chain-of-Thought Prompting\\nsame demonstrations for multiple datasets (e.g., 5/6 of the\\narithmetic datasets). In contrast, Auto-CoT is more flexible and task-adaptive: every single dataset gets its own\\ndemonstrations that are automatically constructed.\\n5.3\\nVisualization of Question Clustering\\nFigure 5 visualizes question clustering (with PCA projection) in ten datasets.

Best known for developing the theory of relativity, he also made important contributions to quantum mechanics, and was thus a central figure in the revolutionary reshaping of the scientific understanding of nature that modern physics accomplished in the first decades of the twentieth century. His mass-energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from relativity theory, has been called 'the world's most famous equation'. He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics 'for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect', a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. In a 1999 poll of 130 leading physicists worldwide by the British journal Physics World, Einstein was ranked the greatest physicist of all time. His intellectual achievements and originality have made Einstein synonymous with genius.\",\n",

We shuffle either of\\nthe demonstration components to see how the performance changes. According to the results in Table 5, shuffling\\nquestions has the least performance reduction (91.7% →73.8%). A possible reason for the decent performance is that\\nthe model may capture the rationale-answer mapping patterns. The pattern is expected to reflect how the intermediate\\nreasoning steps can lead to the final answer. This finding shows that it is possible to leverage the generated rationales\\nby Zero-Shot-CoT because those rationales are often logically correct even though they may lead to wrong answers\\n[Kojima et al., 2022].\\nTable 5: Impact of different components in the demonstrations.\\nMethod\\nAccuracy\\nManual-CoT\\n91.7\\nShuffle Questions\\n73.8\\nShuffle Rationales\\n43.8\\nShuffle Answers\\n17.0\\nExperimental results on ten public benchmark reasoning datasets showed that with GPT-3, Auto-CoT consistently\\nmatches or exceeds the performance of the CoT paradigm that requires manual designs of demonstrations.\\n9\\nthe effect of misleading by similarity (Section 3.1). On the other hand, if we took each demonstration as a kind of skill,\\ndiverse demonstrations seem to cover more alternative skills for solving target questions: even though there still exists\\na small portion (e.g., 1/8) of mistakes in the demonstrations, the performance will not be negatively affected (to be\\nshown in Figure 6).\\nNevertheless, the clustering-based sampling method may still construct a small portion of wrong demonstrations, such\\nas from questions in the frequent-error cluster. As we will show later, some of these wrong demonstrations may be\\neliminated with heuristics. For example, wrong demonstrations often come with long questions and long rationales.\\nUsing simple and generic heuristics, such as only considering shorter questions with shorter rationales, further helps\\nmitigate the effect of imperfect Zero-Shot-CoT capabilities (Appendix C.2).\\n4\\nAuto-CoT: Automatic Chain-of-Thought Prompting\\nsame demonstrations for multiple datasets (e.g., 5/6 of the\\narithmetic datasets).
