"Instruction tuning significantly improves zero-shot performance on unseen tasks compared to models only fine-tuned on the dataset name. This is because training with instructions is crucial for zero-shot performance. 

However, the performance does not appear to saturate, implying that performance may further improve with even more clusters added to instruction tuning.

This is because all model capacity is used to learn the mixture of instruction tuning tasks. The paper also shows that the benefits of instruction tuning are affected by model scale.
